<h1>Victory of the Daleks</h1>
<p>It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.&hellip;hey.&hellip;the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.&hellip;hey.&hellip;the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. You hit me with a cricket bat.</p>

<p>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</p>

<li>Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</li>
<li>It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.</li>

<h3>The Shakespeare Code</h3>
<p>They're not aliens, they're Earth&hellip;liens! You've swallowed a planet! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>
<h4>Gridlock</h4>
<p>Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. You've swallowed a planet! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. No&hellip; It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.</p>

<p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.&hellip;hey.&hellip;the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

<h6>Voyage of the Damned</h6>
<p>You've swallowed a planet! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You've swallowed a planet! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.</p>
